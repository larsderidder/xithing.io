                    <p class="lead">
                        I often read "visionary" articles of the Internet of Things where the
                        author focuses on the things that will change our lives. On the
                        lightbulbs, the doorposts and the bikes that are suddenly made smart[1] 
                        by adding a (micro)processor and some wireless tech to it, and
                        then magically enrich our lives. And while those innovations are
                        great, they're not even half the story.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just making a thing smart can be very valuable by itself of course.
                        Tracking the location of your cat (which is already quite a smart thing) for
                        example can be a lot of fun, and very important as well if he ever
                        decides to get stuck in someone's garage. And to see that a parking
                        spot down the street is empty on Google Maps can be useful as well
                        when telling your friends to come over to help you move. These are
                        great product ideas and are decent examples of the direction in which
                        we are heading, with the advent of Internet of Things technologies such
                        as <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/">LoRa</a>, <a href="http://www.sigfox.com/">Sigfox</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</a>. But they're only the tip of the iceberg.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What we are moving towards is a world where things are not just smart,
                        but able to interact with each other autonomously and intelligently.
                        They will be able to understand each other, perhaps not on the level
                        of natural language, but on the level of needs and intents, of supply
                        and demand. We will get things that are marketeers, things that are
                        producers and things that are consumers. I do hope we wont get door-
                        to-door salesmen, but I'm afraid even that belongs to the
                        possibilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's consider the device that tracks the location of your cat again,
                        and think about it in the context of smart interactions. Cats are
                        notorious for not being able to decide whether they want to be inside
                        or outside, so this cat tracker is also outfitted with a system to
                        broadcast the need of the cat; I want to go through this door[2].
                        Furthermore, imagine that the garage in which he got stuck has a cat
                        door, programmed to only satisfy the need of the house cat to enter,
                        but to allow <em>any</em> cat to leave.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your cat would have no problem getting back out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Does this seem like far-fetched futurology speak? I hope not, because
                        even that's far from where we are going to end up I believe. I mentioned
                        supply and demand, and if I say supply and demand, you say money,
                        right? So let's talk money.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's go back to that empty parking spot in your street from before,
                        let's call it Premium Spot 24. It's a few houses down the street, but
                        all other spots in the street are taken. It can analyze the supply in
                        the street so it knows this, and consequently raises its
                        parking rate. Bad news for your friends? Well, as it turns out there's
                        a nice calm street behind your house, with Tranquil
                        Spot 13 being right behind your house. Your friends' demand is
                        to park nearby one of the doors of your house, so their car will check
                        the supply and find the cheaper spot behind the house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now for the kicker though. Your car broadcasts its demand for a
                        parking spot near your house in a public marketplace, and will receive
                        at least two offers, one for Premium Spot 24 and one for Tranquil Spot
                        13. As Premium Spot 24 sees the lower bid of Tranquil Spot 13, it will
                        be able to <em>lower its price autonomously</em> to attract your friends car. It
                        does this because perhaps it's always busy at this time but people
                        start leaving in half an hour, or because the parking spot operator of
                        this street has opted for an aggressive marketing strategy. Whatever
                        the reason, your friends now have a much nicer offer than they started
                        off with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While smart things will push developments in the right direction, smart interactions are the future of the Internet of Things, and will be the true radical change that everybody is talking about. With more and more things being connected, the possibilities for interactions will rise exponentially. There are still a lot of hurdles to get there however; security and interoperability are huge challenges, and we'll need proper standards to be able to write software to handle these complex interactions. But that's why companies like ours exist.

                    <p>
                        [1] I use "smart" here for lack of a better term. A thing would need much
                        more than just data and processing power to be truly considered smart.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        [2] Cats needs are also notoriously hard to interpret, even with our brains, but using direction of movement, proximity and velocity, we should be able to make a decent guess.
